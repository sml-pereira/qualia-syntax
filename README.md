This repository contains the source code, data, and analytical outputs accompanying the article. The study investigates whether composers' deployment of harmonic qualities---including diatonicity, octatonicity, and whole-tone quality---exhibits systematic patterns that could constitute a *qualia syntax*. Building upon the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of pitch-class sets and its geometric interpretation through the Fourier Qualia Space (FQS), it advances three key contributions: the definition of an ambiguity region in the FQS, a computational methodology for extracting qualia progressions from musical works, and a four-tiered nested analysis examining these progressions across multiple analytical scales.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or later
- The [Yale-Classical Archives Corpus (YCAC)](https://ycac.yale.edu/) installed locally

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/qualia-syntax.git
cd qualia-syntax
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the analysis

1. Open `src/main.py` and set the `CORPUS_DIRECTORY` variable to the path of your local YCAC corpus folder.
2. Run the pipeline:

```bash
cd src
python main.py
```

3. Follow the interactive prompts to select the analysis mode (specific composers or entire corpus).

### Running the sensitivity tests

The robustness analyses reported in the article can be reproduced with:

```bash
python tests/qualiaSyntax_radius_tests.py
python tests/qualiaSyntax_parameter_sensitivity.py
```

## Data description

### Debussy analytical data (`data/debussy/`)

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `complete_dataframe.csv` | Full processed dataframe for Debussy's catalogue, including qualia progressions per piece |
| `conditional_matrix.csv` | Conditional (row-normalised) first-order Markov transition probability matrix |
| `global_matrix.csv` | Global transition percentage matrix across Debussy's qualia progressions |
| `reflets_segments.csv` | Segment-by-segment qualia analysis of *Reflets dans l'eau* (Images, L. 110) |
| `regression_data.csv` | Log-rank vs log-frequency regression data for Zipf analysis |

### Dendrograms (`data/dendrograms/`)

Hierarchical clustering dendrograms (Ward's method, Euclidean distance) for 28 composers spanning the Baroque to early 20th-century periods. Each dendrogram visualises the transitional similarity relationships between the seven harmonic qualities.

### Transition counts (`data/transition_counts/`)

First-order qualia transition count matrices for each composer, provided in both CSV and XLSX formats.

### Diachronic Zipfian analysis (`data/diachronic_zipfian_analysis.csv`)

Regression slopes and y-intercepts for log-rank vs log-frequency plots across all analysed composers, ordered chronologically. This file underpins Figures 8 and 9 of the article.
